Los Medanos Shiny Applications
## Overview
The following programs are in support of the Los Medanos statistics classes. Currently (fall semester 2019), these classes are
listed as Math 110 and Math 110 + Math 110S, but in the past they were offered as several flavors of Math 34 and Math 27.

There are also two programs useful for Discrete Mathematics (Los Medanos Math 160). The first of these uses the extended Euclidean
algorithm to display the linear combination of two positive integers, giving their greatest common divisor. The second performs
fast modular exponentiation.

The Shiny application framework was developed by RStudio, who hosts the web site lmcstatistics.shinyapps.io, and each application
comprises two R programs ui.R and server.R. For an introduction to Shiny, see the RProject website (Add link here).

A description of each application follows.

### Discrete Mathematics Applications
Euclid    (http://lmcstatistics.shinyapps.io/Euclid)
  Finds the GCD of two positive integers along with the linear combination of these integers that yields the GCD.
